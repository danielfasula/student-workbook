# Journal Day 1 - Week 1

## Daily Journal Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use **Git**?

    We use git as a storage place for our code, so it can remain safe from accidents (ie computer damage/loss). Also allows us to share our code and the ability to collaborate with other developers.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

    Multiple branches are important to help support "parralel developments." Meaning different developers are able to work on different portions of an application at the same time withouth interrupting eachothers' work.

3. What is the difference between **Git** and **Git*****Hub***?

    Git allows you to work on local repositories, and GitHub allows for remote repositories.


## Personal Journal Entry

 First day went really well. We were able to meet the instructors and staff that we will be working with for the next 3 months. I can tell that they all love what they do, and really care about our success; and that makes me feel more confident in diving head first into this course and carreer path. Very excited to see how these next few months will go!
