# Journal Day 2

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

    Pseudo-classes allow you to target specific elements in specific occasions. Without much knowledge on them, I think that :first-child and :last-child might be the most common ones we use.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

    Specificity prioroitizes what styling will affect certain properties in your html. One way you can use this to your benefit is trying to use an overall theme for your whole application, but wanting to make a single section look slightly different. You can use specificity to give that section different properties.


3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

    I think over-utilizing !important could cause a lot of confusion. Many of the !important tags could contradict eachother, and seems like it would be really difficult to try and backtrack and fix them.
    

## Personal Journal Entry

    Day 2 was so much fun. I already feel much more confident about my CSS abilities than I was during my Half-Stack course 2 years ago. Trying to replicate the "Cool Website" was challenging, but very fun at the same time. Seeing just how much you can really customize your website is a bit overwhelming, but also very exciting.
