# Journal Day 4 - Week 1

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

    Wire-framing has 3 key purposes. First is to keep the concept user-focused. This allows us to communicate the main ideas of a website or application to other developers, users, or clients. Secondly, it allows us to visualize how the website will work as a whole, and be able to add or delete the necessary items that either the client or developer team decide. Lastly, and probably most importantly, using wire-frames is cheap and easy to create. It allows you to mock up a design without any hard coding, and makes it easier to decide to throw out certain concepts that might have taken so long to create.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

    Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Extremely basic, and rough sketches of design. No proper scaling, mock images and filler text.

    Mid-Fidelity Wireframes: Most common level of wireframes. The content is much more clear and accurate, but still black and white.

    High-Fidelity Wireframes: Usually saved for the end stages of the design cycle, or for more complex ideas that need more relevant text or images.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    I do believe they are worth the T.E.E. It seems like it will be great for brainstorming, giving your webpage a basic outline/skeleton. It'll also allow you to express different ideas; the time it would take to rework an idea in wireframing would be exponentially shorter than actual coding.



## Personal Journal Entry

    Today was our first partner project. Learning to work well with others will be an important skill to have. Being able to discuss ideas without being too demanding or emotional is probably the hardest thing to overcome for some people. It was a lot of fun working with Dallen today. He was just as eager as I was to learn new things and finish the project while having as much fun as possible.
