# Journal Day 1 - Week 10

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

    Value: Variables of this data type directly contain values
    Reference: contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data
    Pointer: 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

    Value data types directly contain values within its own memory space. The main difference, is that any time it is referenced, it creates a new instance of that variable. So if the value changes, it doesnt effect the original value, just that instance of the variable.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

    Reference types get stored memory by referencing a variable elsewhere in the code. Reference types do not have its own value, it is borrowing that value from something else.
