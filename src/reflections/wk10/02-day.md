# Journal Day 2 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

    Lists are pretty much the arrays of C#. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

    Add, Find, FindIndex, Remove, Sort, ToArray, and maybe TrueForAll. Lists seem extremely similar to arrays in functionality and usage, so it seems fitting these methods would be used most often.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

    Setting a variable to equal List[index]. Or another method you could use is Find.
