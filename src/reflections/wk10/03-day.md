## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

    Enums are strongly typed constants. They are unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. Enums lend themselves to more maintainable code because they are symbolic, allowing you to work with integral values but using a meaningful name to do so.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

    You can modify an Enum by changing its base type and member values. Another modification you can make to an enum is to set the value of an enum member.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

    I have noticed the main way we use Enums are when running the CRUD methods. Starting the function with "public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Car>>", which in my best guesses, means the method is going to return an object that has the same base key properties as the "car" model, but with its value properties different.
