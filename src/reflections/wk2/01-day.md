# Journal Day 1 Week 2

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is Scope?

    Scope is the area in which a variable is usable. Whether it is usable globally, or locally (ie specific function).

2. What is Hoisting?

    Hoisting is where functions or variable are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

    Var is used more for globally scoped variables. Let and Const are both used for block scoped variables, but you would use Const for any variables you do not want updated or changed, and Let for all other types of variables.  


## Personal Journal Entry

 Day 1 of Javascript was just as challenging I had expected it to be. The js-basic-tests started somewhat easy, then really ramped up to be extremely difficult. Everything for the most part was simple once I was able to find the correct documents in w3schools, except for the 'switch' statements. I couldn't quite grasp what the first question was asking for me to do. But I'm sure once we go over it in class tomorrow, it'll be something I overlooked and overcomplicated myself.
