# Journal Day 2 Week 2

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

    Function declaration, Function expression and Arrow function expression

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

    Parameters are created and defined within the function, whereas arguments are values that are already defined and ready to be invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

    When a function accepts another function as a parameter or returns a function.
    return str[index].toUpperCase()

## Personal Journal Entry

    Bruh, day 2 was R U F F. Putting the loops and arrays into practice was very difficult. Even having prior knowledge on writing functions didn't help today. Hopefully things will start stringing along and get the hang of everything.

    Going to the first fireside definitely helped me understand things a little bit more. I'm definitely going to make sure I attend all of them from here on out. Darryl does a great job explaining things during class, but it's nice to get a different point of view from another instructor.
