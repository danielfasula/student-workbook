# Journal Day 3 Week 2

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

    - console.log(): when you need to evaluate any data in order to help you write your code.
    - syntax errors: mainly grammatical errors that is not allowing the code to work as functioned.
    - reference errors: lets you know if something is undefined at the time of reference in  your code.
    - type errors: lets you know if you're treating a data type incorrectly ie calling an array method as an object or a string as a number

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

    The Elements tab. It allows you to see any applied classes, ids and events being used within the HTML. It would be helpful during debugging to make sure the right class, id or event is being passed through at the correct times.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

    Using debuggers and breakpoints.

## Personal Journal Entry

 Today felt much better than Monday and Tuesday. I feel like coding in a more practical sense, with a bigger overall goal, made much more sense than the challenges, but I see the importance of knowing how to code on those smaller scales. I feel really proud of how my afternoon project turned out, especially since I was able to compare it to my previous "Rock Paper Scissors" project from the first time I took this course. The differences were night and day.
