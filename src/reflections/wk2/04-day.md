## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

    It gives you a basic structure that you can follow to just get started on the project. Having the main structure, with wiggle room to change, can lead to  more clarity in your code. This is also known as the Waterfall Approach.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

    Colleagues and Google will be your best bet when looking for answers when you're stuck on a problem.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

    You'll learn much more from another person's failures than you could from their successes. No matter where you're at in your carreer, there will always be resources for you to use when you're in need. NEVER THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
