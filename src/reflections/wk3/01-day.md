# Journal Day 1 - Week 3

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

    The main problem exporting solves is allowing a single access point for the javascript into the html, making the rendering much quicker.

2. How does export differ from export default?

    Export allows the transfer of mulitple values within a module, and export default is when there is only one export within the module.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

    Allows you to keep a majority of your code hidden in deeper files.


## Personal Journal Entry
