# Journal Day 2 - Week 3

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

    Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Also allows us to control the manipulation of data much better.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

    Breaking Changes, Leaked Implementation Details, Expanded Attack Surface for Hackers, and Self Documenting Code.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

    Defining a variable in the constructor. You would do this so the variable's data is only accessible withing that scope.

    


## Personal Journal Entry

    Things are definitely making more sense to me now. Being able to apply everything we've learned the first two weeks into a single application, all while condensing the files withing the modules is extremely helpful. Can't wait to see whats next!
