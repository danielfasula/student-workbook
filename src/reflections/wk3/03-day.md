# Journal Day 3 - Week 3

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

    get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

    They must always return the value.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

    Allows the data structure to be private, and lets us control what data is shared with the client through specific rule sets.



## Personal Journal Entry

    Today felt really good! Everything is making sense, and I'm feeling pretty confident in Proxy States and Encapsulation. It's nice being able to go into a project, do what is required with somewhat ease, and be able to try new things and push myself to code out of my comfort zone. I was able to figure out the Navs and Tabs for my gregs list and it turned out SICK!
