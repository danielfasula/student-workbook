    Ways to update parts of a page in response to certain events.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

    Subscribe, Unsubscribe, and Broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

    The observer patterns check to see if any changes have been made to specific data. If any of the data has been changed, it will run a function you tell it to.
