# Journal Day 1 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?

    A good sign would be a code that is pyramid-like, and the cause being the developer trying to write Javascript in which the execution happens visually from top to bottom.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

    Asynchronous means the code isn't running "right now", or will happen in the future. Callbacks are involved by allowing the rest of your code to run, while that function is still thinking, or retrieving the data.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

    1. Consolidate your code and name your functions to make it easier to read. 
    2. Create a bunch of small modules (ie libraries) that handle specific things, and inject those into other, bigger modules that handle more things.
    3. Add a way to resolve or handle every error, making sure each function works as intended.

## Personal Journal Entry

 Day 1 of working with APIs was a lot of fun. It was really nice not having to create our own libraries, and work off of data that is already created. It definitely helps being given a base, and building off of that.
