# Journal Day 2 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions


1. What are the three states of a Promise?

    Pending, Resolved, Rejected

2. How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

    It allows you to attach callbacks to a function, rather than passing them in the function. Makes the code look much cleaner.

3. What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

    .then() will be called when a promise is resolved, and a .catch() is called when a promise is rejected.

## Personal Journal Entry

 Working with API's is becomming a bit easier. It was really cool to extend on an existing project, and adding to it with new tools we had learned.
