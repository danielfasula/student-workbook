# Journal Day 3 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions


1. What is the purpose of Async/Await?

    Async functions are a combination of promises and generators. And await puts the async function on pause until the promise comes back rejected or resolved.

2. What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

    The client function must be defined as async.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

    Much easier to read the code, allows multiple async functions in a series, and easier to debug.

## Personal Journal Entry

 PokeAPI was such a fun project. So much nostalgia creating a project and using pieces of my childhood in it. The thing I had the hardest time with was transferring the data from one server to the next, but I was able to figure it out by the end of the day.
