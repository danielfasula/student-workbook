# Journal Day 4 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

    REpresentational State Transfer. When a RESTful API is called, the server will send a copy of the data, or representation of the state, of the requested resource. 

2. What does Stateless mean?

    Stateless means the server has no recollection of a single user's access to the API. The server only sends what is needed to fulfill the request, regardless of other requests sent by the user.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

    1. An identifier for the resource you are interested in. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the endpoint. In fact, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
    2. The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
