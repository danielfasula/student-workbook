# Journal Day 1 - Week 5

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

## Personal Journal Entry

 Burger shack was a fun project. Nice little intro to creating and handling our own servers.
