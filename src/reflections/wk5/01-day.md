# Journal Day 1 - Week 5

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

    Data can be passed into any request using a query string

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

    ?key=value. Adding an '&' allows you to have multiple query paramaters.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

    It can be helpful by showing the relationships between certain things that you're looking for using the query parameters. Helps you see the flow of the data.
