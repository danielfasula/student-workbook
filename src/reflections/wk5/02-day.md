# Journal Day 2 - Week 5

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

    One to One, One to Many, Many to Many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding?

    Traditional linking is better for when the One has no data size changing, and the Many changes frequently.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

    I think it mainly depends on the sizing of each. If one might be too big, or much more susceptible to change, you might want to change the way they are embedded.

## Personal Journal Entry

 Creating our own Greg's List server helped things make much more sense. Being able to tie it into our front end project we did a few weeks ago was really cool, too. Can't wait to expand on servers in the future.
