# Journal Day 4 - Week 5

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

    Virtual properties are additional fields for a given model.

2. When might you use a virtual property?

    When you don't want to save the actual data into your Schema, but still might need that data later on for something else. It'll also allow you to type out any complex process to find said data only once, and not for each time you need it.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

    Only non-virtual properties are searchable. Virtual properties aren't searchable due to not being part of the Schema.
