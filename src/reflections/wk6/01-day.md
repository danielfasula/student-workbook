# Journal Day 1 - Week 6

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

    A method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

    They allow the DOM to be dynamically updated without the need for a page refresh. Also makes it easier to bundle data together. Where MVC separates structure, helper methods and routing into different levels of the app, components contain all of those features within a single class.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

    It often leads to bloated and polluted views. While using many components, there is a possiblity that readability becomes degraded.

## Personal Journal Entry

 Vue3 Playground was really cool. Vue is going to make creating applications much easier, but I know that just means it will allow us to create even bigger projects now. I can't wait to recreate past projects with Vue and see just how much easier it is.
