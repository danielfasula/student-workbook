    How you pass variables and other info around between different components.

2. What are props used for?

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

    Props are added into the javascript portion of code in Vue, and are accessed or used by the html portion of code in Vue.

## Personal Journal Entry

 The vue-nasa project was really fun. Really drives it home having to understand api's/servers, and knowing how to drill into the data to find what you need. The nasa server was tough at first, but once I got it figured out and how to pull out the data I needed, it was really simple.
