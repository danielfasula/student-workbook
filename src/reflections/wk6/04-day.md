# Journal Day 4 - Week 6

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is a nested route?

    Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

    You might need it for when you have more data of a particular type (users, pictures, etc) that you are wishing to display on your site at the same time.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

    You can. You would pass parameters in order to use the same routing links, but trying to find different data.
