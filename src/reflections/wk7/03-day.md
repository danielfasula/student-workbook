## Daily Journal Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

    User Experience is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. Not only should you consider what YOU want the user to be able to do, and also allowing the USER to do what they want to do when interacting with your business.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

    It allows the user to feel like they are important to your business as an individual, rather than just another client.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

    By keeping your audience's feelings in mind, you can create strong UX that arranges all of your information and interactions in a way that's pleasing to people. And, when the UX of your site or app makes people feel good, they're more likely to stick around and become customers.
