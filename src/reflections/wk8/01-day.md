1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

 Allows you to put your past / current projects on display for employers to look at. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

  Increased visibility and authority. A way to prove you know your craft. A background of work allowing you to get that first position in the industry. It can show your expertise on a subject. Increasing your personal brand. Stand out from a crowd of candidates in interviews.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

 Bloggr, Bug Log, Kanban, and our current Capstone project would by my ideal projects to add to my Portfolio. I think they really portray my abilities as a coder very well. Clean and precise code, easy to read, and the web design might be minimalistic, but I think they're somewhat polished.
