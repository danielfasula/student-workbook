# Journal Day 1 - Week 4

## Daily Journal Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

    MVC, Firebase, SweetAlerts, Toast Notifications. SCRUM.

2. What went well so far?

    Honestly, everything. We all worked really well together. We all had our own skill sets that we brought to the table, and everyone really pulled their own weight. Really proud of my team for how we did as a group and our final product. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

    I really wouldn't change anything. We made sure to plan as much as possible before we even started coding.
